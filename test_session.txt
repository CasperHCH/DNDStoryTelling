D&D Session #15 - The Crystal Caverns

Our adventurers approached the glowing entrance to the Crystal Caverns. The wizard cast detect magic and noticed strong enchantment auras ahead.

"I roll for initiative," said the rogue as shadows moved in the distance.

The party encountered a group of crystal golems defending ancient treasures. Combat ensued with magic missiles, sneak attacks, and healing spells flying back and forth.

After defeating the guardians, they discovered a magical crown that grants +2 to charisma checks.

The session ended with the party deciding to rest in the cavern entrance before exploring deeper chambers.
