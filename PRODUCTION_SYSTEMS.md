    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user_id),
    session_metadata: dict = Body(...)
):
    # Save uploaded file
    file_path = await save_upload_file(file)

    # Process with production system
    result = await production_processor.process_dnd_session(
        file_path, user_id, session_metadata
    )

    return {
