    "version": "1.0.0-test",
    "environment": "test",
    "checks": {
        "database": "healthy",
        "temp_files": {
            "total_files": 0,
            "temp_directory": "temp"
        },
        "api_keys": {
            "openai": "configured",
            "confluence": "configured"
        }
    }
}
```

Testing temp file management...
Created temp file: /app/temp/docker_test/tmpuxq9qqf_.test
File exists: True
File exists after context: False
Stats: {'total_files': 0, 'temp_directory': 'temp', ...}
Temp file management test completed successfully!
```
